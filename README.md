This is a mirror of http://openoffice3.web.fc2.com, a website with LOTS of sample macros for
OpenOffice (and, by extension, LibreOffice and NeoOffice). This mirror has been done in the
hope to better preserve the contents presented, and to facilitate downloads.

Probably best used by just doing

    git clone https://github.com/loveencounterflow/OpenOffice-macros.git

in a location of your choice.
